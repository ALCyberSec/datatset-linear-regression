    "Powerball is an American lottery game offered by 44 states. It is coordinated by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is 40$ million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 graduated installments or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead.\n",

    "Drawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. Eastern Time. Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chHalogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of Edgewater Park, New Jersey.osen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play. Each play costs  2,or 3 with the Power Play option.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum Powerball bet is $2. In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal pseudorandomly select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n",
